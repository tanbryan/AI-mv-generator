[00:16.76]We were both young when I first saw you
[00:20.53]I close my eyes and the flashback starts
[00:25.15]I am standing there
[00:27.33]On a balcony in summer air
[00:32.90]See the lights, see the party
[00:35.50]the ballgowns
[00:36.93]See you make your way through the crowd
[00:40.20]And say hello
[00:44.00]Little did I know
[00:48.76]That you were Romeo
[00:50.53]You were throwing pebbles
[00:52.60]And my daddy said
[00:53.90]Stay away from Juliet
[00:56.36]And I was crying on the staircase
[00:59.13]Begging you, Please dont go,
[01:03.66]And I said
[01:05.16]Romeo, take me
[01:07.16]Somewhere we can be alone
[01:09.30]I will be waiting
[01:11.20]All there is left to do is run
[01:13.26]You will be the prince
[01:14.76]And I will be the princess
[01:17.33]It is a love story
[01:19.30]Baby, just say yes
[01:25.66]So I sneak out to the garden to see you
[01:29.36]We keep quiet cause we are dead if they knew
[01:32.66]So close your eyes
[01:35.66]Escape this town for a little while
[01:41.16]Cause you were Romeo
[01:42.76]I was a scarlet letter
[01:45.66]And my daddy said
[01:46.36]Stay away from Juliet
[01:48.73]But you were everything to me
[01:51.10]I was begging you
[01:52.40]Please dont go
[01:56.10]And I said
[01:57.60]Romeo, take me
[01:59.60]Somewhere we can be alone
[02:01.73]I will be waiting
[02:03.70]All there is left to do is run
[02:05.70]You will be the prince
[02:07.20]And I will be the princess
[02:09.73]It is a love story
[02:11.73]Baby, just say yes
[02:13.73]Romeo, save me
[02:15.53]They are trying to tell me how to feel
[02:17.96]This love is difficult
[02:20.66]but it is real
[02:21.86]Dont be afraid
[02:23.33]We will make it out of this mess
[02:25.86]It is a love story
[02:27.86]Baby, just say yes
[02:44.96]I got tired of waiting
[02:49.00]Wondering if you were ever coming around
[02:52.76]My faith in you is fading
[02:57.60]When I met you on the outskirts of town
[03:00.90]And I said
[03:02.16]Romeo, save me
[03:04.20]I have been feeling so alone
[03:06.20]I keep waiting for you
[03:08.76]But you never come
[03:10.33]Is this in my head?
[03:11.86]I dont know what to think
[03:13.80]He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
[03:17.60]And said
[03:18.30]Marry me, Juliet
[03:20.10]You will never have to be alone
[03:22.33]I love you and that is all I really know
[03:26.13]I talked to your dad
[03:27.90]You will pick out a white dress
[03:30.40]It is a love story
[03:32.40]Baby, just say yes
[03:46.50]We were both young when I first saw you
